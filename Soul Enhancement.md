The [[Body]], [[Mind]] and [[Karma]] can be viewed as [[Physical]], [[Mental]] and [[Astral]] expressions of the soul. In this sense the soul serves as a fourth perspective in which only the self exists. However unlike the other three perspectives, the soul exists independently of local reality, as evidenced by the fact that the soul can traverse the [[Sea of Chaos]].

As with the other perspectives a sufficiently strong soul can exert change within the context of it's perspective. In the case of the soul this means affecting the self only. 

Soul Enhancement is the act of improving an aspect of oneself by exerting force with the soul. Any action or aspect of the self can be enhanced in this way. Be it mental fortitude, physical strength or karmic connections. However no permanent changes can be made in this way.

By training the soul as a muscle or through consuming soul enhancing medicine the strength of the soul can be improved, this is known as [[Soul Growth]] or the oldest ladder.
