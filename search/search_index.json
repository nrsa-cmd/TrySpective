This creates an additional bottleneck for gods as they can only reliably use a handful of servants to exert their strength (Even large international churches often have less than two people past the 4th Bottleneck and even for them it can be harmful to channel too much divine strength). Hero Summoning has been developed to circumvent part of this issue.</p> <p>Souls from another world are brought over and given a divine blessing that takes the place of a soul core, preemptively solving the biggest issue for passing the 4th bottleneck. In addition, unlike a regular soul core, this blessing is designed to handle larger than normal infusions of divine power creating a servant of the divine without equal.</p> <p>Why not locals?     A soul core can not be implanted from the outside, at least not into a fully formed soul. Souls on Earth (Earth being in a low Reality) are diffuse/incomplete. Bringing them over gives a short window of opportunity where a blessing can be applied before the soul grows complete.</p> <p>Who is chosen?     Imparting a blessing is a significant investment for a deity and most have only one active hero at a time due to this. The hero summoning ritual searches for a soul that best matches the gods current needs/personality and then utilizes Fate magic (which Earth humans have no defense against due to lacking Astral) to induce a fatal accident.</p> <p>What happens next?     The (short) travel through Chaos, impartment of the blessing and first exposure to Astral cause significant stress on the soul. To mitigate this and ensure a smooth transition (in particular to keep Karma/Mind/Body somewhat balanced) the soul is reborn. Their memories/mind slowly return as their new body and karma mature, with full mental capacity typically reached by the age of 5. Being born with a fully fledged soul core means Heroes are typically operating at at least twice the strength of their peers and have little to no difficulty passing the 4th Bottleneck when the time comes.</p> <p>The Hero Summoning ritual is ancient magic created by gods of yore. It can be tapped into by any deity. (Potentially: Occasionally a recently departed soul might be caught by the Hero Summoning rituals feelers as it keeps track of potential targets and gets reincarnated by the ritual without applying a divine blessing.
