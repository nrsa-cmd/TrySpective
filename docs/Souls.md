Souls are an exception to the [triality](Reality.md) While object can be fully described with the three perspectives ([[Astral]], [[Physical]], [[Mental]]) sentient beings possess capacities beyond those of simple objects. In the astral this can be seen in the form of [[Karma]], in the mental in the form of [[Mind]].

The soul is what makes sentient beings different from objects, it is free will. The origin of action and objective self. While body, mind and karma only ever tell part of the story, the soul contains all of them.

The soul is the center point of the self and is the primary subject method of exceeding the limitations of nonliving things through [[Soul Enhancement]].
