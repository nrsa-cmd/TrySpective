# Setting Overview

Design goals: Enable a wide variety of powers and power systems. Allowing magic, psychics, martials to coexist while also providing a shared power scaling framework to make it easy to keep them roughly equal.

Additionally the setting should organically support tropes like Summoning people from other worlds or LitRPG elements.

Also waste my time I guess.

Reading should probably (maybe) start at [Reality](Reality.md).
