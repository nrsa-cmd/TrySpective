Skills are the equivalent of [[Soul Engravings]] within in the artificial [[Soul Growth]] enhancing [[System]].

The system manages, carves and enhances soul engravings when a skill is acquired. The kind and quality of skills offered differs based on the users grade. it should be noted that skills, as they are engravings, don't grant new abilities they simply make one better at things they could theoretically do already. Though when first picking a skill the system can provide rudimentary knowledge or techniques through [[Mental]] impartments.

Note while higher grade Skills can leverage [[Soul Force]] better than lower grade Skills, lower Grade Skills continue to grow throughout higher grades. This means while using a higher Grade Skill tends to be preferable one can always fall back to the often more generic lower grade skills.

Grade 0:

No Skills are offered.

Grade 1:

Skills are relatively simple. Can be broad or specific. Get leveled from 1 to 20. The possible number of skills is as follows:

- 3 Broad + 2 Specific
- 2 Broad + 4 Specific
- 1 Broad + 8 Specific

Example Broad Skills (Domains)

- Sword Mastery
- Constitution (Boost toughness etc.)
- Spell Mastery (Fire)
- Spell Mastery (All, Weaker than fire)
- Spell Mastery (Steam, Boosted by similar Skills. E.g. Spell Mastery (Fire))
- Telepathy
- Telepathy (Read Only)

Example Specific Skills (Techniques)

- Mind Spike (Relatively rudimentary method of directly assaulting another mind with your own)
- Flame Blast
- Dodge Roll

Grade 2:

Skills at Grade 2 are synergy or fusion skills based on the acquired Grade 1 Skills. These skills reflect engravings designed to enhance the positive interference between the Grade 1 engravings and to lessen any negative interference. Synergy/Fusion skills must be acquired for each pair of Grade 1 Skills. Get leveled from 1 to 20. Grade 1 Skills continue to level based on the progress of their associated Grade 2 Skills (20 to 40).

Domain + Domain = Fused Domain

- Sword Style (Flaming Blade) (Sword Mastery + Spell Mastery (Fire), focuses on layering swords with flame magic to create devastating swings)
- Sword Style (Flaming Tempest) (Sword Mastery + Spell Mastery (Fire), focuses on using fire magic to support the martial mastery like creating a cloak of fire for cover/short range AOE, creating explosions for sudden bursts of speed.)
- Spell Synergy (Steam, Fire) (Further boosts Steam magic through the use of fire magic. Enhances the pre-existing synergy)

Domain + Technique = Enhanced/Modified Technique

- Mind Pierce (Mind Spike + Telepathy) (Uses telepathy to find weak spots for more efficient Mind Spike usage)

Technique + Technique = Fused Technique

- Punishing Dodge (Mind Spike + Dodge Roll) (Launches a Mind Spike at the same time as dodging an attack, uses the fact that the attacker is likely less focused on shielding their mind while attacking while also interrupting said attack making it easier to dodge)
- Mental Parry (Mind Spike + Dodge Roll) (Deflect mental attacks with a Mind Spike)

This means someone with only one G1 domain skill won't have a G2 domain skill. This results in a wider range of technique skills all of which more specific but typically more potent than domain equivalents but also means that actions outside of those relatively narrow techniques need to fall back on G1 or G0 enhancement.

Grade 3:

Skills at Grade 3 are improved versions of Grade 2 Skills. They represent the act of fitting skills to the individual soul. All Grade 2 Skills need to be evolved. Grade 3 Skills can get leveled indefinitely (1 - ???), Grade 2 Skills are replaced by their evolutions, Grade 1 Skills continue to level based on their associated Grade 3 Skills (40 - ???) 

- Sunblade Form (Sword Style (Flaming Blade)) (Focuses all the heat at the edge of the sword to create unblockable strikes)
- Fear Spike (Mind Pierce) (Utilizes the targets fears to reach deeper and more vulnerable parts of the targets mind)

Grade 4:

Grade 4 doesn't offer new skills (Though G3 skills continue to level). Instead at the start of G4 a single Unique Skill is chosen. This is the equivalent of a [[Soul Core]]

- The Blade That Divides The World (Bladed Weapons can cut not just on a [[Physical]] but also on a [[Mental]]/[[Astral]] level. Cutting away memories or severing cause and effect)
