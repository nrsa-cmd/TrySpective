The [[Physical]] body of creatures is their their presence from a physical perspective. For a human that is their flesh, blood, bones..., their brain and their [mana](Spellcasting.md).

The brain is the physical representation of the [[Mind]]. As such damage to the brain can cause damage to the mind and vice versa as both are ultimately the same thing looked at from different angles.

The mana is the physical representation of the [[Karma]]. Exhausting mana exhaust the Karma and vice versa.
