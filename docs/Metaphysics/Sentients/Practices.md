These are a couple of common or rare combat focused pursuits. They're mostly disciplines a person can focus on in their training not anything metaphysically fixed (Though some or all of these might be Classes within the [[System]]). Though a person can focus on more than one of these it is often better to keep the number low as there's only so much space within the soul for matching [[Soul Engravings]] (technically one can practice one or more of these without matching engravings but the efficiency at higher grades will consequently suffer. Like a mage practicing spells of all elements but having engravings solely supporting fire spells will often find that fire spells are more useful to them even when other spells would have an elemental advantage simply because the [[Soul Enhancement]] is that much greater).

These are further split into three categories: Monolithic, Dualist and Holistic. Monolithic practices focus exclusively on one aspect of the self ([[Body]]/[[Mind]]/[[Karma]]) and typically only reinforce the others defensively if at all. Dualistic practices seek synergy between two aspects and Holistic practices integrate all aspects of the self into a functioning whole. 

## Monolithic:

### Pros:

 - Generally lower skill floor
 - Engravings can be more focused and therefore be stronger
 - It's easier to fit utility/defensive engravings into the soul as fewer engravings are needed for full effectiveness

### Cons:

 - Severely lacking in active defenses for two aspects
 - Severely lacking in general awareness for two aspects

### Examples:

#### Pure martial (Physical):

Focuses on mastering the body (this includes brain and passive mana use). Trains up reflexes/muscle memory. Trains up muscles. Mana pool gets integrated into the muscle tissue over time (normal response: Mana is the physical representation of Karma and while Karma isn't actively used by Pure Martials the dedication to their path still shapes their fate/future -> Karma in passive ways.

Common Feats: Punch, Stab, Slash...

#### Elemental Mage (Physical):

Commonly misconceived as a Karma Monolith. Elemental Mages focus on manipulating the natural elements through mana. This only indirectly touches on Karma as mana is just the physical representation of it. Creation of matter is generally impossible.

Common Feats: Generate/throw Flames (not matter), throw around matter, ...

#### Witch (Karma):

Manipulate the connection between things more than things themselves. Typically balance oriented towards a special theme.

Common Feats: Strike a bargain guaranteed by fate, redistribute astral burdens (i.e. If you're an asshole to people that causes people not to like you, this kind of cause<->effect relationship can be exploited by witches, like change the target of the hate or turn the hate into adoration... Any cause<->effect relationship can be manipulated in such ways though the Law of Equivalence (The more the result of an action differs from all perspectives of current reality the harder the action is to perform) applies.)

#### Telepath (Mental):

Interact with the Minds of others.

Common Feats: Mind Reading, Thought transmission, Empathy, ...


## Dualist:

### Pros:

 - More well rounded than Monolithic practices
 - Still relatively flexible in terms of engravements

### Cons:

 - Major shortcomings in one of the aspects
 - Less room for utility/versatility engravings than monolithic practices

### Examples:

#### Fate Martials (Physical + Karma):

In addition to practicing martial techniques they immerse themselves in the river of fate. 

Common Feats: Combat Precognition, Path to Victory style decision making in combat, ...

#### Esper (Mental + Physical)

Alter physical reality with thought alone.

Common Feats: Telekinesis, Electrokinesis, ...

## Holistic

### Pros:

 - Covers all aspects of reality
### Cons:

 - Functionally no room for engravings outside of those meant to support the practice
 - Typically high skill floor

### Examples

#### Exemplar

Bind their own Karma into fixed forms, tied to both physical features or objects as well as mental constructs. These forms are called Ikons and are stable structures when viewed from any of the three perspectives. On the physical side an Ikon can be a body part or an item.

Common Feats: Possess a sword that drinks the blood of enemies and rejuvenates the owner, Possess near impenetrable skin, ...

## Multiple Practices

Monolithic practices in particular often leave enough wiggle room to add engravings that support another monolithic practice. Additionally Dualistic and Holistic practices can sometimes be supported with engravings that are general enough to also encompass other practices.

### Examples:

- An Exemplar with a sword Ikon will likely practice swordplay and might even generalize their engravings enough to not just support the sword Ikon but to be usable with any sword
- A Brawler might choose to train themselves in the ability to assail others minds in some fashion to serve as a distraction in combat and add supporting engravings for that
