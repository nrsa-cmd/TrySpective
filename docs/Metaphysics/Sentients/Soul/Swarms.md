Swarms/hives can exhibit complex patterns of behavior even if no individual member is making conscious choices. A sufficiently coherent and organized swarm appears to have a collective [[Mind]], the individual members of the swarm serve both as limbs and as processing units. 

If the swarm as whole is complex enough to exhibit free will and therefore has a visible [[Mind]] and [[Karma]] instead of simply being surrounded by [[Mental]]/[[Astral]] impressions then it also exhibits a [soul](Souls). The soul is not localized in any one member but is present within every part of the swarm simultaneously.

### Body: 

The whole of the swarm.

### Mind:

Typically denser the more members of the swarm are present. Individual members far away from the swarm might only show faint imprints/traces of the swarms mind.

### Karma:

Typically denser the more members of the swarm are present.

### Soul:

Not localized. Present across the entirety of the swarm.

### Notes:

Mutations: Typically don't affect individual members but rather all/specific subsets (like warrior caste ants getting other mutations)
[[Soul Engravings]]: Typically designed for enhancement of specific subgroups
