Cultivation uses outside sources of power and energies to facilitate [[Soul Growth]].

[[Soul Engravings]] are made to match the cultivators understanding of the cosmos (as they call it the Dao). This allows the absorption of outside energies to smoothen and improve the lines.

E.g. A cultivator engraving their understanding of Fire onto their soul can then absorb fire attuned energies from a treasure to create artificial resonance within their soul and use that resonance to further improve their patterns. 

These same principles apply to all four bottlenecks allowing cultivators the smoothest progression, however the reliance on expensive resources and the time consuming nature of absorbing and meditating on outside energies makes them the slowest to progress as well. Still to a cultivator breaking through a bottleneck can be as easy as visiting a market.
