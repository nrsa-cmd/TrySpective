The methodology behind improving the soul and achieving greater levels of [[Soul Enhancement]]. At the most basic the souls strength can be improved by exercising it like a muscle or consuming medicine that forcefully reinforces the soul. These methods improve the raw power behind the soul, typically referred to as [[Soul Force]]. 

However souls eventually reach a series of bottlenecks at which further exercise can no longer improve its Soul Force or at which the soul can not leverage additional Soul Force even if it were accumulated.

# Balanced Souls

### Grade 0

Actions are enhanced through amplifying corresponding oscillations. There are two primary limiting factors to this:

- Soul Density: This determines the maximum amount of amplification can happen. Simply put more soul stuff = bigger amplitudes are possible. Waves in a puddle can't be larger than waves in a bathtub.
- Membrane Strength: This determines how easily waves can be amplified.

Simple exercise/repetition can increases both properties in tandem and are, in conjunction, typically referred to as [[Soul Force]] (SF). Note: Due to the Membrane Strength being a function of the souls surface and Soul Density a function of the souls volume they don't scale equally. 

#### Bottleneck:

When scaling SF linearly through G0 there comes a point when further growth of the density will 'pop' the membrane due to increased pressure. This is the limit of G0.

#### Notes:

Soul size is a function of how capable an entity is of affecting the outside world. I.e. Larger/stronger Body/Mind/Karma result in a larger soul. Dragons are a good example for this as they are likely the most powerful balanced sentients. Possessing incredible bodies, sharp minds and immutable karma. This however comes at multiple disadvantages.

- Enhancement comes from amplifying oscillations within the soul, in this case it doesn't matter how large the soul is as only the amplitude not the width of the wave matters
- Worse Membrane/Density ratio. (See square-cube-law) A larger soul means the peak of G0 is reached at much lower Soul Density relative to weaker creatures. This means a dragon will always need more effort for less of an amplification. (Though obviously their baseline is much greater). This also effectively increases the quality requirements for engravings.
### Grade 1

[[Soul Engravings]] are patterns in the soul attached to the Soul Membrane. Most crudely by enhancing the same action over and over one can create pressure inside the soul long enough to solidify specific parts similar to how the membrane naturally solidifies due to outside pressures. Advantages:

- They improve the stability of the Membrane, allowing for further SF growth without bursting the membrane
- They cause additional resonance with actions that formed them/similar actions. This can amplify these oscillations beyond normal enhancement.

#### Bottleneck:

As permanent structures these engravings permanently shape and alter the flow of soul around them. Once the membrane is fully/mostly covered by engravings these changes interfere with each other in typically erratic ways. These turbulences paired with Density outpacing Membrane Strength create the limit of G1 after which further improving SF is impossible.

### Grade 2

Progress through Grade 2 is characterized by managing and shaping the interactions between different engravings. Advantages:

- By removing turbulences and smoothing out flow/introducing harmonic interactions the Membrane can be further shielded form the internal pressure and further SF growth is possible. 
- The resonance from adjacent/harmonized engravings improves corresponding actions to an even greater degree.

#### Limits:

As the soul flow becomes increasingly dominated by engravings these alterations begin to conflict with the Soul's unique internal melody. If this gets out of hand it can cause severe issues with self-perception/stability and internal ruptures.

### Grade 3

Progress through Grade 3 is characterized by harmonizing engravings with the Soul's ideal rhythm/melody. This typically requires deep introspection to be feasible. Advantages:

- Further SF growth without tearing up the Soul's insides
- Additional Resonance with the Soul's background rhythm further enhances the actions.

#### Limits:

By harmonizing engravings with the internal melody and further increasing SF the background flow of the soul reaches intensities it cannot safely withstand over long periods of time.

### Grade 4

Entrance into G4 is characterized by forming a [[Soul Core]]. Unlike G1-3 this is the first stage to deal with a new type of soul structure. Soul Cores serve as bedrock to handle and ground the soul's flow. Advantages:

- Increased Stability. By letting all flows play off of the Soul Core it serves as fulcrum to absorb and handle the background pressure of the Soul
- Increased Resonance. By supplying a more stable structure to resonate with corresponding actions can be further boosted
- Unique wave forms. Unlike engravings which must roughly match actions that can be performed the Soul Core needs to only match the internal melody. This, depending on the person, can create waves not directly matching any action they can normally perform. By stimulating the Soul Core such waves can, however be created anyways which in turn means entirely new and normally impossible actions can be performed. (Since the wave exists, so must the action since they are literally the same thing)

#### Limits:

Option 1)
At this stage the soul is an extremely volatile mix of different forces pulling and pushing. Growing SF only heightens these pressures until the Soul Core cannot fully keep up.
Option 2)
With the Soul Core stabilizing everything normal exercise doesn't sufficiently improve SF after a certain point.
Option 3)
???


### Additional Notes:

Requirements on quality/stability of Engravings keep increasing throughout the grades. While G2 is characterized by the effort of harmonizing different engravings it is still necessary to continually improve the engravings themselves to keep up with the mounting pressure. The same is true for G3/4. In general any training/refinement done in earlier grades must be continuously kept up in higher grades as well.

### Methodologies

#### Default

Simply perform engravings, scrub those that don't and improve those that do. The most basic and straightforward method of progress.

#### [[Cultivation]]

Cultivation is a set of soul growth methods tailored towards accepting outside concepts into the soul in order to smoothen the various processes. Through meditation and absorbing energies from outside sources (often called treasures by cultivators) gathering power becomes faster and easier.

#### Superpowers

A method of soul growth that seeks to smooth out progression through the fourth bottleneck at the cost of more limited early progression. Instead of performing wide ranging engravings early on this method focuses on a singular engraving similar to a [[Soul Core]]. 

As this singular engraving needs to hold the entire power of the soul, requirements to the 2nd and 3rd bottleneck are much higher than normal. The result is a singular focus on just one or a small number of specific abilities.

#### [[System]]

Created by a pantheon of ambitious [deities](Deity.md) from across the moral spectrum the System massively simplifies soul growth. It offers basic Classes to anyone (Warrior, Mage, ...) as well as skills. By gathering XP (an artificial reward by the system) one gains Levels and new Skills. These are not true gifts of the systems but in truth simple aids.

# Tilted Souls

Any action matching the soul's tilt is enhanced at baseline. These oscillations, similar to engravings, can solidify due to consistent pressure. However since there is no membrane to attach to these fibers instead directly hook in place. This means instead of floating in/stretching around the soul they alter the structure of the soul and by extension the structure of the self. This is the basis for mutations which are the backbone of tilted soul growth. 

Unlike Engravings, which only exist from a soul perspective, mutations exist from both the soul perspective and the perspective of the tilt. While mutations result in strengthened oscillations (like engravings) this is reflected both soul- and tilt-side. Unlike engravings however mutations are only weakly visible from a soul perspective, they are less visible structures and more connection points. Like the endpoint of a fiber that stretches out of the soul-perspective. This is because mutations are ultimately multi-perspective structures.

E.g.

A wolf bites a lot. Through consistent effort this results in a mutation. If examined one will find the muscles around the wolves jaw are significantly denser/stronger than they should be corresponding to a permanent fixture in the wolves soul. Mutations can also come about as the result of extreme external stimuli.
### Grade 0:

Mutation fibers stretch into and out of the soul perspective, growth in G0 is achieved by acquiring mutations and growing soul density inside them (Soul density inside the rest of the soul can't grow because there is no membrane to contain it). This process both makes the mutation more pronounces tilt-side and strengthens the cross-section soul-side.

#### Limits:

Mutation fibers like soul membranes are subject to the square-cube law and rupture if grown too full.

### Grade 1 Mutations:

???? Maybe weave mutations together, like a fiber braid or some shit ????

### Grade 2 Mutations:

???? Create soul side engraving like structures to better anchor the fibers and supply soul side enhancement of oscillations ???

### Grade 3 Mutations:

????


# Mixed Souls

### Tilted -> Balanced:

Once the tilt side of the soul is sufficiently covered in mutation fiber ends these can collectively serve as a pseudo membrane. By flexing this partial membrane it is possible to counteract the uneven pressures and form a proper membrane around the sections the soul tilts away from. Enabling a sort of normal soul growth.

### Balanced -> Tilt

The pressure of a tilted soul can be emulated through flexing/manipulation of the membrane and as a result mutations can be manually formed. This will tilt the soul towards the direction of the fibers.

### Advantages:

More versatility in how the soul can be shaped

### Disadvantages:

Mutation fibers are an additional stress factor on the membrane, resulting in reduced soul density capacity.
