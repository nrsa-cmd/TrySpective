## Basics

The methodology behind improving the soul and achieving greater levels of [[Soul Enhancement]]. At the most basic the souls strength can be improved by exercising it like a muscle or consuming medicine that forcefully reinforces the soul. These methods improve the raw power behind the soul, typically referred to as [[Soul Force]]. 

However souls eventually reach a series of bottlenecks at which further exercise can no longer improve its Soul Force or at which the soul can not leverage additional Soul Force even if it were accumulated.

## Grades
### Grade 0

Growth at this stage is achieved by simply growing more Soul Force.

As the first bottleneck is approached it becomes increasingly difficult to accumulate Soul Force. The soul lacks ordered support structures needed to hold onto more than a certain amount of power. The method to pass the first bottleneck is introducing [[Soul Engravings]]. These are permanent markings on the soul which resonate with specific aspects of the self and serve as anchors for additional growth.

### Grade 1

Past the first bottleneck growth is achieved by adding and spreading Soul Engravings and growing more Soul Force.

The second bottleneck appears when soul engravings begin to cover most of the soul. At this stage the engravings begin to interfere with each other. Further growth is impossible without harmonizing the engravements to prevent interference.

### Grade 2

Past the second bottleneck growth is achieved by deepening existing Soul Engravings, eliminating negative interference between engravings and growing more Soul Force.

When the engravings reach near perfect harmony other factors start to matter more. The less the interference between engravings matters the greater a different kind of interference starts to emerge. The soul is the whole of the self as such the engravings must not only harmonize with each other but also with the inherent structure of the soul. This requires insight into ones own personality and self delusions can easily prevent further growth at this stage.

### Grade 3

Past the third bottleneck growth is achieved by further improving engravings (depth, interference with other engravings, harmonizing with soul structure) and growing more Soul Force.

The fourth bottleneck is the natural limit of the soul. Accumulating power past this point is not simply increasingly difficult but impossible without drastic changes as the soul would simply rupture and destroy itself. To house the additional power a [[Soul Core]] must be formed which servers as the foundation for further growth.

### Grade 4

Past the fourth bottleneck growth is achieved by by improving all aspects of engravings, growing more Soul Force, improving the Soul Core and connecting/incorporating engravings with the Soul Core.

Eventually a limit is reached at which the Soul Core cannot hold onto additional Soul Force, the fifth bottleneck. Come up with more shit here. Maybe growth past this point requires unique methods dependent on the individual. 

## Methodologies

### Default

Simply perform engravings, scrub those that don't and improve those that do. The most basic and straightforward method of progress.

### [[Cultivation]]

Cultivation is a set of soul growth methods tailored towards accepting outside concepts into the soul in order to smoothen the various processes. Through meditation and absorbing energies from outside sources (often called treasures by cultivators) gathering power becomes faster and easier.

### Superpowers

A method of soul growth that seeks to smooth out progression through the fourth bottleneck at the cost of more limited early progression. Instead of performing wide ranging engravings early on this method focuses on a singular engraving similar to a [[Soul Core]]. 

As this singular engraving needs to hold the entire power of the soul, requirements to the 2nd and 3rd bottleneck are much higher than normal. The result is a singular focus on just one or a small number of specific abilities.

### [[System]]

Created by a pantheon of ambitious [deities](Deity.md) from across the moral spectrum the System massively simplifies soul growth. It offers basic Classes to anyone (Warrior, Mage, ...) as well as skills. By gathering XP (an artificial reward by the system) one gains Levels and new Skills. These are not true gifts of the systems but in truth simple aids.
