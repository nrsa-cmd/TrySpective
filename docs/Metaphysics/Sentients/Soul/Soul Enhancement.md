The [[Body]], [[Mind]] and [[Karma]] can be viewed as [[Physical]], [[Mental]] and [[Astral]] expressions of the soul. In this sense the soul serves as a fourth perspective in which only the self exists. However unlike the other three perspectives, the soul exists independently of local reality, as evidenced by the fact that the soul can traverse the [[Sea of Chaos]].

As with the other perspectives a sufficiently strong soul can exert change within the context of it's perspective. In the case of the soul this means affecting the self only. 

Unlike the internal [soul](Souls) matter, which is simply vibrating with the melody of the self the membrane is solid enough to be manipulated directly. This means that, when it oscillates due to some kind of action (Be it internal or external) it is possible to strengthen or weaken that oscillation by treating the membrane as a kind of muscle. Since these oscillations are the same as the actions that cause them (just observed from the perspective of the soul) this directly correlates to an amplification or dampening of the action itself.

This ultimately works because Soul/Body/Mind/Karma aren't different things, they are the same thing observed through a different lens.

E.g. 
The action of hammering a nail looks like oscillations originating near the membrane. By flexing the membrane to strengthen this oscillation one also strengthens the impact the hammer has on the nail despite not actually putting in more muscle strength.

Conversely if one is being stabbed this too appears as an oscillation and keeping the membrane taught to weaken this oscillations also inhibits the knife stabbing into the body.

Purely internal stimuli are no different, while the oscillations don't originate near the membrane they can still travel there and flexing the membrane can still strengthen/weaken them.
