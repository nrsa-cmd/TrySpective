Souls are an exception to the [triality](Reality.md) While object can be fully described with the three perspectives ([[Astral]], [[Physical]], [[Mental]]) sentient beings possess capacities beyond those of simple objects. In the astral this can be seen in the form of [[Karma]], in the mental in the form of [[Mind]].

Souls are a fourth perspective of reality resulting from sentience, or free will. All free willed things have a soul, though the size, shape and strength of the soul can wildly differ between sentient entities.

The soul is the perspective of 'Self'. From the perspective of the soul nothing outside of the soul exists, therefore it can not interact with or be interacted with by any outside forces. Nor can it be detected by outside senses under normal circumstances.

The soul is the center point of the self and is the primary subject method of exceeding the limitations of nonliving things through [[Soul Enhancement]].

The soul is constantly experiencing changes in the form of vibrations coming from two sources.

 - Internal Stimuli: These represent the processes innate to sentience. Every decision made reverberates throughout the soul culminating in a distinct melody that describes the unique self.
 - External Stimuli: Not strictly speaking different except for their point of origin. When one interacts with the outside or is interacted with by the outside then the ripples originate at the very edge of the soul.
## Balanced Souls

When Body/Mind/Karma are in balance/harmony then souls are roughly spherical. 

External Stimuli, if consistent and of sufficient strength exert a constant pressure on the soul. If this pressure persists and is applied from all directions at once (Astral/Physical/Mental) then the outermost layer of the soul is condensed into a membrane. For most balanced sentients this process is completed at birth.

## Tilted Souls

Most sentient entities do not possess balanced souls. Most common animals for instance possess bodies far outstripping their minds. In this case souls can't stabilize into a fixed form and can't form a membrane. 
Instead souls are pressured to more closely align with and connect to these discrepancies (this is called tilt). Actions matching their tilt reverberate stronger while other actions have much weaker oscillations.

### Note:

The enhanced reverberations are a result of mismatched pressures. I.e. A wolf with a weak mind is still exposed to a similar amount of Mental pressure as a human (similar sized souls), but since their mind is significantly weaker that pressure instead pushes the soul away from mental actions and towards physical/astral actions.
