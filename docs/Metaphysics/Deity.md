Something akin to a [hivemind](Swarms) cannot only form for lesser, soulless creatures. When sentients form societies or tribes and these begin to exhibit sufficiently complex decision making of their own then said cultures can form [[Souls]] of their own. These are typically more complex than the souls of swarms.

These souls are referred to as gods. Members of the hive are referred to as followers.

Special/Additional conclusions:

- Since followers possess free will of their own there is less of a correlation between the action of a single follower and the god's soul. Only actions specifically taken for and because of the collective reverberate with the god's soul at all.
- Splinters within a society or the merger of multiple societies can create multiple separate gods.
- Either due to an active push on the gods part to retain individuality or because the society is splintered across sub-faction gods within a pantheon are typically associated with specific causes/philosophies
- A gods personality is dependent on it's followers and their thoughts and choices and is less free to develop on it's own unlike lesser hive-souls which are not dependent on other sentients
- Since the [[Body]] (though not [[Karma]]/[[Mind]]) of the god is made up of the bodies of it's followers their and their followers souls partially overlap (in the case of pantheons the souls of the individual gods overlap as well)
- Enhancement performed by a god is typically weakly spread across a large number of individuals (A society doesn't swing a single sword it sends forth an army and therefore so does a god enhance armies not soldiers.
- Due to the overlap between souls a god can theoretically directly pressure/induce waves within a followers soul (this is different from normal enhancement where a god enhances their own action) however the souls of gods are significantly more vast than that of a single follower. Therefore this pressure is usually going to cause massive strain which is worsened the less similar the follower is to the god
- A blessing/divine core serves to stabilize a hero's soul so that such empowerments only cause temporary stress not permanent damage (if done in moderation). See [[Hero Summoning]]
