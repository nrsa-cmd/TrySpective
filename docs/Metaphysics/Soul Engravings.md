Soul Engravings serve as both scaffolding during [[Soul Growth]] and as sources of resonance for [[Soul Enhancement]].

As one performs certain actions (e.g. swinging a sword) and enhances them through [[Soul Force]] ripples reverberate throughout the soul. An engraving is an anchor along such a reverberation, stabilizing it and increasing the power of the enhancement.

This increase is improved both by growing and refining a specific engraving but also by harmonizing the engraving with surrounding and with the structure of the soul (removing negative interference and creating positive interference). These methods correlate to the first, second and third bottleneck of [[Soul Growth]].
