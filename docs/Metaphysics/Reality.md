## Basics

Reality, space-time etc. A catch all term for all places in which stable existence is possible. 

Countless universes separated by/embedded in the [[Sea of Chaos]]. Universes or local realities are trialities. That is to say they can be described in three equally correct ways. This is similar to the wave-particle duality of light in that light can be described as both a particle and a wave with different characteristics dominating depending on circumstance.

The three perspectives are [[Astral]], [[Mental]] and [[Physical]]

## Low Reality

Not all universes are created equal. While all can be described with all of the three perspectives in some universes some of the perspectives are less real than the others. Perhaps existing in concept but not in practice.

E.g. Our universe has strong [[Physical]] realism but weak [[Mental]] and [[Astral]] realism. While thoughts, cause and effect etc. obviously exist they can only be observed as a function of physical reality, they do not stand on their own.

[[Souls]] in low realities are typically anemic, crooked or incomplete as they lack one or more thirds of its expression. This makes [[Soul Enhancement]] and [[Soul Growth]] impossible,
