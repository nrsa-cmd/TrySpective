The practice of affecting the [[Mental]] through the use of ones [[Mind]].

At the most basic this is reading and manipulating other things from a mental perspective. Seeing/hearing things like thoughts/emotions/memories etc. and manipulating through exertion of the [[Mind]].

Advanced methods utilize the fact that the [triality](Reality) isn't separated but different ways of viewing the same thing. It is therefore possible, through purely mental effort, to effect physical changes. E.g. creating lightning by imagining the sensations and effects of it,

People who utilize Mentalism are typically referred to as Psychics or Espers.
