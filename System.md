## Basics

The system is an artificial magical construct created, powered and maintained by a pantheon of various [deities](Deity) to facilitate easier [[Soul Growth]] for their followers. 

The system must be installed either at birth or with the aid of a skilled soul mage. It only functions within the area of influence of the pantheon powering the system, though exiting this area only prevents further growth not access to already acquired abilities.
## Classes

The system offers basic classes to anyone. XP is awarded by the system for completing challenging activities or completing quests. On level up the system increases the users [[Soul Force]]. Aside from this the class determines what skills are offered by the system.

### Skills

Classes offer skills at different levels. These skills correspondent to [[Soul Engravings]]. Leveling skills is the system improving and deepening engravings. The system automatically ensures that offered skills do not interfere with each other and are grown appropriately.

### Class Evolutions

After maxing out a class or after achieving particularly difficult tasks the system offers class evolutions. These will be easier to level in ways that match past behavior and offer superior skills.

### Unique Skills

Unique skills are the way in which the system represents [[Soul Core]]s. They serve as powerful abilities that serve as cornerstones for further development.
## Bottlenecks

The first and second bottleneck of [[Soul Growth]] are functionally nonexistent for system users. This is because the system handles [[Soul Engravings]] and ensures non-interference by offering only skills that match each other.

The third and fourth bottleneck are more significant issues as the system cannot easily analyze each and every soul. To analyze souls to a deeper degree the soul must be observed during times of extreme stress and effort as these make slight interference with the souls inherent structure more obvious. 

These deeper scans are expressed by the system as Achievements and serve as a measure for how deeply the system understands a soul and serve as opportunities for the system to dig deeper into the soul so it can enact more intensive future changes.  As a result progress in third and fourth grade requires frequent life or death struggles.

Additionally it is best to pick classes and skills that represent the users true desires/self as these are likely easier for the system to adjust to the soul.
